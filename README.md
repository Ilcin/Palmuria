# Palmuria

Palmuria – A fantastic world at the rim of the apocalypse \
Palmuria is a concept for a 2D-Point-and-Click-Adventure-Game that has been developed in my 3rd semester as project of the course ‘Storyworlds’ at TUM in a group of 3 students. Therefore we have implemented a vertical slice – a small demo of the game showing the game mechanics, introducing the characters and giving an orientation for the aesthetic concept.
The game tells the story of the 14 years old protagonist Kei, 
who is destined to save his home planet which has fallen out of orbit and is now approaching the sun. 
With his homemade robotic dog, the most annoying classmate he has ever seen, and an emotionless Cyber-lady named
Mayrie as his mentor he finds his way trough the almost dried out planet. Finding new material to continue his journey in 
ancient ruins or the only futuristic city he learns that enemies do not always function on moral logic, even arrogant snobs 
can become a friend if given enough time and of course – how to save the world.
